# men-seed

Work in progress.

This project is an application skeleton for a typical MEN (MongoDB, Express, NodeJS) restful api.

## Getting started

To get you started you can simply clone the men-seed repository and install the dependencies

### Clone men-seed

```bash
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:guilhermecvm/men-seed.git <your-project-name>
```

The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.

### Install dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```

### Run the application
```bash
npm start
```

Or if you want to run in cluster mode

```bash
npm run cluster
```

After that just navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
